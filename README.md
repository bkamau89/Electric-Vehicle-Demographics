# ⚡ Electric Vehicle Landscape Analysis – Washington State

This project delivers actionable intelligence on Washington State’s **electric vehicle (EV) market** using SQL and Power BI. By highlighting adoption trends, manufacturer competition, and infrastructure gaps, it supports smarter investments, policy decisions, and business strategies.

## 📊 Project Overview

An **interactive dashboard** was built to uncover EV adoption patterns and deliver insights for policymakers, utilities, investors, and dealerships. The analysis turns **1.4M+ vehicle records** into a clear picture of market growth, adoption hotspots, and future opportunities.

Dataset: Washington State EV registration data (Data.gov) – **1.4M+ records**

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

* **SQL Data Processing**: Ensured high-quality data through cleaning, validation, and KPI development (adoption rates, growth trends, average range, CAFV eligibility, and market share).
* **Power BI Dashboard**: Designed an interactive platform with geographic mapping, time-series analysis, and drilldowns by county, make, and model.

## 📌 Key Findings

* **247K EVs registered** statewide, with **90.6% CAFV eligible**
* **Tesla holds 64% market share**; Model Y (52K) and Model 3 (37K) dominate
* **King County** leads with **50% of all EVs**; rural counties remain under-penetrated
* **Average range increased** from \~100 miles (2010) → 300+ miles (2023)
